es6 vs commonJs
- tried change package.json and made socket.cjs to enable requires
- tried changing to .mjs for main and DUngeonScene

NOPE was wrong version of Phaser nedds to be 3.55.2

ISSUES
-- correctly adding players and others- DONE
-- correct disconnect -FIXED
-- all scenes have same configuration- DONE
-- get individual colors working on otherPlayers DONE also increased initial char spacing TEMP FIX
-- verify all socketIO protocols work
-- health downcount and display update working
-- combat works
-- exits work
-- randomize sceneSeed when server starts
-- find way to make first room max size everytime and assign starting positions
-- load up on server
