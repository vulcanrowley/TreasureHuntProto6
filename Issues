es6 vs commonJs
- tried change package.json and made socket.cjs to enable requires
- tried changing to .mjs for main and DUngeonScene

NOPE was wrong version of Phaser nedds to be 3.55.2

ISSUES
-- correctly adding players and others- DONE
-- correct disconnect -FIXED
-- all scenes have same configuration- DONE
-- get individual colors working on otherPlayers DONE also increased initial char spacing TEMP FIX
-- verify all socketIO protocols work - MOSTLY DONE
-- health downcount and display update working -DONE
-- combat works - DONE
--- late joiner code corrects for Treasure Chest taken but doesn't reset food pots
-- exits work - DONE
-- randomize sceneSeed when server starts - disable during Dev

Note: dead player will rejoin Lobby as new player and can rejoin game that killed 
his first incarnation - is this OK?
